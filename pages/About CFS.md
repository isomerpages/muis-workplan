**Work Plan Seminar (WPS)**<br>
Muis has annually organised our Work Plan Seminar (WPS) to share our year-long achievements and seek feedback on our key policies and programmes. <br>

**Community Forward Seminar (CFS)**<br>
For this year, in lieu of a WPS, we will be conducting a Community Forward Seminar (CFS) for targeted and specific group from enterprises and community organisations dealing with the development of our asatizah and religious institutions such as mosques and madrasah.

**CFS aims to:**<br>
• Deep dive into 7th Muis 3-Year Plan (7M3YP) workstreams which require co-creation and cross-sector collaboration<br>
• Deepen the dynamism and intensity of stakeholder engagements<br>
• Strengthen the intra-sectoral partnerships
