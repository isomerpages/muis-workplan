The Muis Work Plan Seminar (WPS) is an annual platform to share with the Singapore Muslim community on the work that was accomplished in the preceding year, and engage with key stakeholders on Muis' current and future initiatives.

From 2023 onwards, the Muis Community Forward Seminar (CFS) aims to:

• Deep dive into 7M3YP workstreams which require co-creation and cross-sector collaboration

• Deepen the dynamism and intensity of stakeholder engagements

• Strengthen the intra-sectoral partnerships
