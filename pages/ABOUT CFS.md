**Work Plan Seminar (WPS)**<br>
Muis has annually organised our Work Plan Seminar (WPS) to share our year-long achievements and seek feedback on our key policies and programmes. <br>

**Community Forward Seminar (CFS)**<br>
For 2023, in lieu of a WPS, we will be organising a Community Forward Seminar (CFS) for enterprises and community organisations involved in the development of our asatizah and religious institutions such as mosques and madrasah.

The theme for CFS 2023 is "Strengthening the Community of Tomorrow, Today".
